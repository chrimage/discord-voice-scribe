# Project Brief: Discord Recording Bot

## Executive Summary

This project brief outlines the development of a Discord bot designed to record, store, and manage voice conversations. The bot will solve the problem of transient discussions in voice channels by creating a persistent, accessible audio archive. It will target Discord communities, such as teams holding meetings, podcast groups, or online classes, who need an easy way to capture and retrieve their conversations. The bot's key value proposition is its simplicity: users can start/stop recordings with simple slash commands and access a downloadable list of all recordings, with each speaker's audio automatically mixed into a single file.

## Problem Statement

Discord voice channels are powerful for real-time communication, but their content is ephemeral. Once a conversation ends, the information and decisions made within it are lost unless someone diligently takes manual notes. This presents several challenges:

* **Loss of Information:** Valuable discussions, brainstorming sessions, team meetings, and community events simply disappear.
* **Inaccessibility for Absentees:** Team members or community members who cannot attend a live session have no way to catch up on what was discussed.
* **Lack of Verifiable Record:** Without a recording, there is no official record of decisions made or topics covered, which can lead to misinterpretations or disputes.
* **High-Effort Manual Solutions:** Existing solutions involve complex, multi-application setups (e.g., routing desktop audio into a separate recording program) that are not user-friendly and can be unreliable.

The core problem is the lack of a simple, integrated way to capture and archive important voice conversations within the Discord platform itself.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a specialized Discord bot that provides a seamless, integrated voice recording experience. The bot will function as a utility that can be summoned to any voice channel to capture conversations and make them available for later access.

The core of the solution revolves around three simple slash commands:

1.  **/join**: Adds the bot to the user's current voice channel and immediately begins recording. The bot will capture audio from each participant in a separate audio stream to ensure clarity.
2.  **/stop**: Stops the recording and dismisses the bot from the voice channel. In the background, the bot will automatically mix the individual speaker streams into a single, cohesive audio file.
3.  **/recordings**: Provides the user with a list of all past recordings from the server. Each item in the list will include metadata (e.g., channel name, date, duration) and a direct download link to the mixed audio file.

This approach provides a low-friction, high-value solution that feels like a native part of the Discord experience, solving the problem of ephemeral conversations without requiring users to manage external software.

## Target Users

#### Primary User Segment: Business Teams

* **Profile:** Remote or hybrid teams using Discord as a primary communication hub for daily stand-ups, project meetings, brainstorming sessions, and decision-making.
* **Needs & Pain Points:** They need a reliable way to document meetings without a dedicated notetaker. They suffer from information loss when team members are absent and need a "source of truth" for what was discussed and agreed upon.
* **Goals:** To improve team alignment, create a searchable archive of key decisions, and ensure all members, regardless of their attendance, are on the same page.

#### Secondary User Segment: Podcast & Content Creators

* **Profile:** Individuals or groups who use Discord to co-record interviews, panel discussions, or gameplay commentary for public distribution.
* **Needs & Pain Points:** They require high-quality audio recordings and often need separate audio tracks for each speaker to allow for easier post-production and editing. They struggle with complex audio routing software.
* **Goals:** To simplify their recording workflow, capture the best possible audio directly within their community platform, and reduce the time spent on technical setup.

## Goals & Success Metrics

#### Project Goals

* **Goal 1 (Core Functionality):** Successfully implement a bot that can reliably join a voice channel, record each speaker, stop on command, and mix the audio into a single downloadable file.
* **Goal 2 (Usability):** Ensure the `/join`, `/stop`, and `/recordings` commands are intuitive and function as expected for your own day-to-day use.
* **Goal 3 (Stability):** The bot should operate without significant errors or crashes during typical recording sessions for your business team.

#### Success Metrics

* **Primary Metric:** The final tool meets your specific needs for recording and retrieving your team's conversations, eliminating any previous manual workarounds.
* **Secondary Metric:** The bot is stable enough that you would feel comfortable sharing it with a friend or colleague if they had a similar need.

## MVP Scope

#### Core Features (Must Have)

* **Feature 1: Join & Record Command (`/join`)**: The bot must be able to join the user's current voice channel and begin recording. It must record a separate audio file for each speaker.
* **Feature 2: Stop & Process Command (`/stop`)**: The bot must be able to stop the recording and leave the channel. Upon stopping, it must automatically mix the separate speaker files into a single master file.
* **Feature 3: List & Download Command (`/recordings`)**: The bot must provide a command that lists all previous recordings and includes a direct download link for each one.

#### Out of Scope for MVP

* **Transcription:** The bot will not automatically transcribe the audio recordings.
* **In-Discord Playback:** The bot will not have the ability to play back recordings directly within a Discord channel.
* **Advanced Audio Controls:** Features like per-user volume mixing, noise suppression, or advanced audio formats (e.g., `.flac`) are not included in the initial version.
* **User Permissions:** The MVP will not have a complex permissions system; all users with access to the commands can use them.

#### MVP Success Criteria

* A user can successfully record a multi-person conversation and download a single, coherent mixed audio file that is clear enough for review.

## Post-MVP Vision

Once the core recording functionality is stable and meets your needs, the following features could be considered for future development. These are not commitments, but rather a list of potential enhancements.

#### Phase 2 Features

* **Audio Transcription:** Integrate a speech-to-text service to automatically generate a text transcript of the recorded conversation.
* **User-Specific Permissions:** Introduce a role-based system to control who can start, stop, or access recordings.
* **Advanced Audio Output:** Provide options to download individual speaker tracks (in addition to the mix) or to download recordings in different audio formats (e.g., MP3, FLAC).

#### Long-term Vision

* The bot could evolve into a comprehensive meeting assistant, offering features like summaries, keyword highlighting, and searchable archives of all recorded content.

#### Expansion Opportunities

* If you ever decided to share the tool more widely, you could consider a "premium" version with features like extended storage, team-based organization, or integrations with other platforms like Slack or Notion.

## Technical Considerations

#### Platform Requirements

* **Target Platforms:** This will be a Discord Bot, running on a server.
* **Performance Requirements:** The bot should be able to process and mix recordings for a 1-hour conversation with up to 10 participants in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., under 5 minutes).

#### Technology Preferences

* **Backend Language:** **Python** with the **`discord.py`** library.
* **Database:** **SQLite** for storing recording metadata, chosen for its simplicity and because it requires no separate database server setup.
* **Hosting/Infrastructure:** The bot will be hosted on a **Vultr VPS**.
* **File Storage:** Audio files will be stored on the **local filesystem** of the Vultr VPS. This is a simple and direct approach for the MVP. Object storage is a potential future enhancement but is out of scope for now to avoid setup complexity.

#### Integration Requirements

* **Primary Integration:** Discord API.
* **Audio Processing:** An audio library compatible with Python will be required for mixing the audio files (e.g., FFMpeg, pydub).

#### Security/Compliance

* The bot will need to handle Discord API tokens securely.
* Audio files stored locally will need appropriate file permissions to ensure they are not publicly accessible.

## Constraints & Assumptions

#### Constraints

* **Hosting:** The solution must be deployable on a Vultr VPS.
* **Technology Stack:** The project must be developed using Python with `discord.py` and use SQLite for its database.
* **Deployment:** The application must be containerized and managed using **Docker and Docker Compose**.
* **File Storage:** For the MVP, audio recordings must be stored on the local filesystem of the hosting VPS.
* **Discord API Limitations:** The project is bound by the terms of service and any rate limits imposed by the Discord API.

#### Key Assumptions

* It is assumed that the Vultr VPS will have sufficient CPU, RAM, and disk space to handle the recording, processing, and storage of audio files.
* It is assumed the bot will be granted the necessary permissions (e.g., "Connect," "Speak," "Read Message History") within any Discord server it's invited to.
* It is assumed that the `discord.py` library's voice client can capture separate audio streams for each user, as this is critical to the core requirements.

## Risks & Open Questions

#### Key Risks

* **Discord API Changes:** Discord could change its API in a way that breaks the bot's recording functionality.
* **Audio Processing Complexity:** Mixing multiple audio streams can be CPU-intensive. A high number of simultaneous speakers could cause performance issues on the Vultr VPS.
* **Storage Management:** Storing audio files on the local filesystem could lead to the server running out of disk space over time if recordings are not manually managed and cleaned up.

#### Open Questions

* What specific audio mixing library (e.g., FFMpeg) will be used, and what are its dependencies?
* What is the best audio format and quality setting to balance file size and clarity?
* How will the `/recordings` command handle pagination if the list of recordings becomes very long?

#### Areas Needing Further Research

* We need to confirm that `discord.py` allows for the simultaneous capture of separate audio streams for each user in a voice channel. This capability is a critical dependency for the entire project.
